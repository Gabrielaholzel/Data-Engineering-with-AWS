## Building Data Warehouses with AWS Redshift

We use  [AWS Redshift(opens in a new tab)](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/)  and ETL techniques to build and query the dimensional model required to support analytical processes required in a data warehouse.

In this lesson, we practise using data services on the AWS cloud platform to build and manage data services as well as AWS Redshift.


## Using AWS Data Services

### Amazon Web Services

Amazon Web Services is one of the largest providers in the cloud computing industry, with over 140 services in compute, storage, databases, networking, developer tools, security, and more. In this lesson, we practise a few essential tools and services in AWS and practice using them. These services can be accessed in three different ways: the **AWS Management Console**, the **Command Line Interface (CLI)**, or **Software Development Kits (SDKs)**, which can be used in combination.

In this lesson, we use the AWS Management Console, which is the web user interface. We also use the **AWS CLI**, which is a useful way to control and automate your services with code, as well as the **BOTO3 SDK**, which will allow you to easily integrate services with your applications through APIs built around specific languages and platforms.
