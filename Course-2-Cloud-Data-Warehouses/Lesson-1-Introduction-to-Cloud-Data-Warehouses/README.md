## Introduction to Data Warehouses

The data warehouse plays a crucial role in the modern enterprise, storing and serving data for data visualization, analytics, and machine learning applications. As a data engineer, you likely will be tasked with designing and building these important data platforms.

A data warehouse is a system including processes, technologies & data representations that enables us to support analytical processes.

## Tools and Environment

In this course, we use a combination of tools in the classroom and the cloud alongside the Python programming language to practice data warehouse techniques.  **Workspaces are provided in the course**. We use Amazon Web Services cloud platform tools to practice processing and storing data in the cloud.

### Python

All exercises and the course project are presented in the Python programming language.

We use Python and SQL to write scripts that extract, transform, and load data.

### Amazon Web Services (AWS)

We work on the AWS cloud platform to run cloud data warehouses. This course uses the following AWS data platform tools:

-   Simple Storage Service (S3)
-   AWS Redshift
-   AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)

### Local Environment

There's no need to download and install anything for this course, workspaces are provided in the classroom and the AWS environment; however, if you'd like to use these tools on your local computer, you can download and install the following:
